## Pig Game
I worked on a project to develop a simple game called Pig Game using Python. The game involves players taking turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, and adding all roll results to a running total of 100, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. My team and I decided to convert a rolling dice to being able to play virtually, either by yourself or with another player, and with two versions of the game available to play.

## 2 Turbo V6 Engine
A drawing of a 2 Turbo V6 Engine using SolidWorks to gain a better understanding of how an engine works. The engine contains 18 parts:

  1. Piston
  2. Crank Shaft
  3. Engine Block
  4. Rocker Arm
  5. Cylinder Arm
  6. Exhaust Manifold
  7. Air Filter 
  8. Cam Shaft 
  9. Valve 
  10. Rocker Spring
  11. Belt Wheels 
  12. Intake Manifold 
  13. Front Cover 
  14. Oil Pan
  15. Air Turbo 
  16. Valves Cover
  17. C. Retainer
  18. C. Bushings 

Currently, I'm drawing the air filter and will continue to finish this project. 

## MemAid
A fun, interactive game for people who have dementia or any sort of memory problems. This game prevents memory loss and stimulates their brain for an alloted time. It is a rectangular prism game board with color-shaped holes on top with a timer and drawer built in. Pawns with color-shaped bases and a triangular dice come included. The game can be played by a person or two and the rules are simple. The player remembers the shape and color of the pawns before inserting them into the board. Each turn the player rolls the dice and whatever it lands on, the player needs to remember a pawn that matches the shape and color from the dice and choose one. The player has a time limit which the player can set it to whatever time. Each time the player chooses the correct one, the player gets a point. 

My team and I are on the last phase and will be 3D priniting it to present to our MEEN 210 class.

## 3lb Combat Robot
Designing and building a 3lb combat robot for competition. I'm designing the armor of the robot which include the wedge, forks, and armor attachment.
